# ML-Class-KNN-Model
This is a practice of ML-KNN model and understanding the details of KNN

## Dataset
This practice use "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set" 

url: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29

## Question
classify whether the subject is "benign" or "malignant" (attribute 11). Implement the
k-NN classifier for the classification task. To begin one experiment, randomly
draw 70 % of the instances from each class for training and the rest are for
testing. Repeat the drawing and the k-NN classification 10 times and compute
the average accuracy. Then, plot the curve of k versus accuracy for k = 3, ..., 15.

## Tips
1.Because the dataset of "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set" have some ? value
  so we need to check the dataset and let it clean

2.Randomly draw 70% fot training & 30% for Testing

3.Repeat 10 times and compute the average accuracy

4.plot the curve of k versus accuracy for k = 3, ..., 15

## Conclusion
