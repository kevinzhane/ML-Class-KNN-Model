# ML-Class-KNN-Model
This is a practice of ML-KNN model and understanding the details of KNN

## Dataset
This practice use "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set"

## Question
1.classify whether the subject is "benign" or "malignant" (attribute 11). Implement the
  k-NN classifier for the classification task. To begin one experiment, randomly  draw 
  70 % of the instances from each class for training and the rest are for testing. 
  Repeat the drawing and the k-NN classification 10 times and compute the average 
  accuracy. Then, plot the curve of k versus accuracy for k = 3, ..., 15.

2.compute the covariance matrix of the dataset. The matrix  is of size 9 × 9 
  (attribute 2 – 10). Do you see strong correlation between any two attributes?

## Tips
1.Because the dataset of "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set" have some ? value
  so we need to check the dataset and let it clean

  Randomly draw 70% fot training & 30% for Testing

  Repeat 10 times and compute the average accuracy

  plot the curve of k versus accuracy for k = 3, ..., 15

## Conclusion
